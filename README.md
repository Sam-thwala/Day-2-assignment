1. Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?

Fundamental Concepts of Version Control:
Tracking Changes: Version control systems monitor modifications to files, maintaining a history of changes. This allows developers to understand what changes were made, who made them, and when. 

Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work. Version control systems manage and merge changes from different contributors, facilitating seamless collaboration. 

Branching and Merging: Developers can create branches to work on new features or bug fixes independently of the main codebase. Once the work is complete, these branches can be merged back into the main codebase, integrating the new changes. 

Reversion: If a new change introduces issues, version control allows developers to revert to a previous stable state, ensuring that problematic changes do not disrupt the project's integrity.
